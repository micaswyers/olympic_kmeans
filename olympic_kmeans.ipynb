    "# K-Means Clustering with Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "After this workshop, you will be able to:\n",
    "* describe the k-means clustering algorithm\n",
    "* understand the limits of k-means clustering\n",
    "* edit and execute cells in a Jupyter notebook\n",

    "## Chapter 0: What does *k-means* mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "K-means is a clustering algorithm to divide groups of data into *k* number of clusters. It is unsupervised learning, so the clustering happens on unlabeled, unclassified data without any guidance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps are:\n",
    "1. Initialize *k* cluster centers (\"centroids\") within the parameters of the data\n",
    "2. Assign each datapoint to its closest centroid, usually by [Euclidean distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance).\n",
    "3. Update the location of each cluster's centroid.\n",
    "4. Repeat steps 2 & 3 until the clusters don't change.\n",
    "\n",
    "![K-Means Clustering](static/kmeans.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### When should I use k-means?\n",
    "\n",
    "K-means clustering works well on data sets with points that are distinct or well-separated from each other in a linear fashion. For picking the number of centroids, it is useful to pick a *k* value that is well-defined in the data already.\n",
    "\n",
    "Datasets that have a lot of overlap, outliers, and noise do not lend themselves well to k-means clustering.\n",
    "\n",
